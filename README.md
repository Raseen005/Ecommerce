An E-commerce SQL database is a structured repository designed to store and manage data for online retail operations. It serves as a foundational 
component for organizing and retrieving information related to customers, products, orders, and inventory. The database utilizes the Structured Query Language (SQL) to define tables, 
relationships, and queries, ensuring efficient and secure data handling. Through tables like Customers, Products, Orders, and Inventory, the database enables the systematic storage of customer details, 
product information, order records, and inventory levels. This organized structure facilitates seamless interactions between different components of an e-commerce system, supporting tasks such as order processing,
inventory management, and customer relationship tracking. The E-commerce SQL database plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and 
reliability of online retail platforms by providing a centralized and efficient means of storing and retrieving essential data.
